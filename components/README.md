# Components

Reusable UI components that can be used across the application.

## Structure

- `ui/` - shadcn/ui components (auto-generated with `bunx shadcn@latest add`)
- Shared components that are not feature-specific

## Guidelines

- Keep components small and focused
- Use TypeScript for type safety
- Follow low-data principles (lazy load images, minimize bundle size)
- Include loading and error states where applicable
