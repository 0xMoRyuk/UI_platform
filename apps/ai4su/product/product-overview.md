# AI4Startups

## Description
A showcase website presenting the AI4Startups program results before project closure (March 2026), highlighting open-source AI models, hackathon outcomes, ecosystem activities, and program impact across Africa.

## Problems & Solutions

### Problem 1: Limited AI Resources Visibility
African startups lack visibility into available AI resources for local contexts. The product provides an open-source model repository (~24 models) with GitHub links and centralized documentation.

### Problem 2: Scattered Program Results
Program results are scattered and hard to access. The product offers a centralized Toolbox page with studies, reports, and best practices in one location.

### Problem 3: Undocumented Hackathon Outcomes
Hackathon outcomes aren't well documented or reusable. The product provides structured hackathon pages with challenge briefs, best practices reports, and results.

### Problem 4: Unclear Ecosystem Impact
Ecosystem impact is unclear to institutional stakeholders. The product includes a KPI dashboard with interactive metrics and visualizations.

### Problem 5: Uncertain Post-Project Maintenance
Post-project maintenance is uncertain after March 2026. The product uses static, lightweight architecture compatible with GitHub Pages.
